# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code)
when working with code in this repository.

**IMPORTANT: The working directory is already set to the
project root. NEVER use `cd` to the project root or
`git -C <dir>` -- blanket permission rules cannot be
set for commands starting with `cd` or `git -C`, so
they require manual approval every time.**

## Project Overview

`bellwether` is a Rust server that aggregates data from
Home Assistant and the Open-Meteo Forecast API,
renders server-side e-ink layouts (black/white or
grayscale), and serves them to a TRMNL e-paper display
via webhook. Intended to run on a Raspberry Pi (host
name `malina`).

**New here?** Read
[`docs/developer/HANDOFF.md`](docs/developer/HANDOFF.md)
first — it contains the current build state, open
decisions that block future PRs, recommended next PRs,
and user preferences that are not derivable from the
code.

- **Stack**: Rust/Axum backend with a hand-rolled HTML
  landing page; static e-ink image renderer
- **Target platforms**: Linux (primary, for RPi
  deployment); Windows and macOS for development

### Workspace Crates

| Crate | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `crates/bellwether` | Core library + CLI binary |
| `crates/bellwether-web` | Axum web server, TRMNL webhook, render endpoint |
| `xtask` | Build automation |

The web crate is optional. To remove it: delete
`crates/bellwether-web/` and remove
`"crates/bellwether-web"` from `Cargo.toml` workspace
members.

The server serves a hand-rolled HTML landing page at
`/` listing its endpoints — no frontend build step or
SPA scaffold.

## Build Commands

```bash
cargo xtask check             # fast compile check
cargo xtask validate          # fmt + clippy + tests + coverage
cargo xtask test [filter]     # tests only
cargo xtask test --ignored    # run #[ignore]-tagged tests
cargo xtask clippy            # lint only
cargo xtask coverage          # coverage only (>=90%)
cargo xtask fmt               # format code
cargo xtask dupes             # code duplication check
cargo xtask deploy-setup      # one-time RPi provisioning
cargo xtask deploy            # build + deploy to RPi
cargo xtask preview           # regen dashboard sample + serve
                              # SVG/PNG/BMP viewer at :8123
```

See `deploy/README.md` for deployment details.

Never use raw `cargo test` or `cargo clippy` -- always
go through `xtask`.

### Local development

```bash
cargo run -p bellwether-web -- --config config.toml
# then open http://localhost:3100
```

`--dev` runs without a config file using localhost
defaults (useful for iterating on the landing page or
endpoints without live Home Assistant / Open-Meteo
data; the publish loop is skipped).

### PowerShell Build Script

```powershell
.\build.ps1 validate    # cargo xtask validate
.\build.ps1 test        # tests only
.\build.ps1 dev         # run backend in dev mode
.\build.ps1 build       # full build with all checks
.\build.ps1 clean       # clean artifacts
```

## Coding Standards

- Rust edition 2024
- `#[deny(warnings)]` and `#[forbid(unsafe_code)]` via
  workspace lints
- Clippy pedantic where practical
- Error handling: `thiserror` for library errors,
  `anyhow` for CLI errors
- Prefer `&str` over `String` in function signatures
- All public items must have doc comments
- Wrap markdown at 80 characters per line
- Maximum code line width: 80 characters (`rustfmt.toml`)

## Test-Driven Development

TDD is the default discipline for functional changes,
but the strict red/green ceremony applies only where
it actually produces signal. Distinguish two cases:

**Behaviour change** -- new logic in existing code, a
bug fix in shipped code, a new state transition, an
edge-case branch in a function whose other branches
already have tests:

1. **Red** -- write a failing test that describes
   the expected behaviour
2. **Green** -- write the minimal code to make the
   test pass
3. **Refactor** -- clean up while keeping tests
   green

Here the pre-implementation test failure is real
signal: it proves the test actually exercises the
new path and that the surrounding code was indeed
not already covering it. Run `cargo xtask test`
after each step to confirm the cycle.

**Structural addition** -- a new self-contained
module, a new helper function, a new enum variant
with no callers yet, a new xtask subcommand with
embedded unit tests:

Write test and implementation together as a single
unit. The whole unit lands or doesn't. Strict
red/green here is theatre: the test and impl get
written together regardless, because the unit is
too small to meaningfully fail-then-pass, and the
`unimplemented!()`-stub-first dance adds no signal.

If you're unsure which case applies, default to the
behaviour-change discipline. The cost of an
unnecessary red step is low; the cost of skipping a
real red step (and shipping a test that always
passed) is high.

## Commits

**All commits must go through the `/commit` skill.**
Never use `git commit` directly. No "Co-Authored-By",
no emoji.

## Acceptance Criteria

Before completing any task, run `cargo xtask validate`,
which checks:

1. **Formatting**: `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
2. **No warnings**:
   `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
3. **All tests pass**: `cargo test`
4. **Coverage >= 90%**
5. **Code duplication <= 6%** (production code, tests
   excluded)

## Semantic Versioning

Follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** -- breaking changes
- **MINOR** -- new features, backwards-compatible
- **PATCH** -- bug fixes, documentation, internal refactors

The version lives in `crates/bellwether/Cargo.toml` and
is the **single source of truth**.

## Release Notes

Maintain `CHANGELOG.md` using the
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
format. Group changes under: **Added**, **Changed**,
**Fixed**, **Removed**.

Always keep an `[Unreleased]` section at the top.

## Template Sync

This project tracks its template origin in
`.template-sync.toml`. Use `/template-sync` to pull
improvements from the upstream
[rustbase](https://github.com/breki/rustbase) template.
The command fetches upstream changes, categorizes them,
and helps you selectively apply relevant updates while
preserving your project's customizations.

## Template Feedback

This project was generated from the
[rustbase](https://github.com/breki/rustbase) template.
When you notice anything in the template-provided files
that is suboptimal, incorrect, outdated, or could be
improved, log it in `docs/developer/template-feedback.md`.

Examples of what to log:
- Dependency versions that needed immediate updating
- Config that didn't work out of the box
- Patterns that had to be reworked early on
- Missing features that every project ends up adding
- Conventions that turned out to be impractical
- Unnecessary boilerplate that was deleted

This feedback will be used to improve the template for
future projects.

The file uses three sections (see its header for
section semantics): **Open divergences** (gaps the
project intentionally keeps), **Resolved** (gaps closed
by retrofit work), and **Suggestions to flow back to
the template**. `/template-improve` routes new entries
into the appropriate section.

## Workspace lints and xtask overrides

The workspace forbids `unsafe_code` via
`[workspace.lints.rust]` so production crates inherit
the policy by default. If a derived project needs OS-
specific code in `xtask/` (for example, calling Win32
APIs for process management on Windows -- the canonical
case being `OpenProcess` / `TerminateProcess` /
`CreateToolhelp32Snapshot` for stale-server cleanup),
the recipe is to redefine the lints block locally for
`xtask` only rather than weakening the workspace policy:

```toml
# xtask/Cargo.toml
[lints.rust]
warnings = "deny"
unsafe_code = "allow"   # xtask is build tooling, scoped exception

[lints.clippy]
# inherit the workspace clippy block by re-declaring
# or by overriding selectively
```

Production crates keep `[lints] workspace = true` and
remain `unsafe`-forbidden. Document the scoped
exception with a comment near the use site so reviewers
can verify the unsafe block is genuinely necessary.

## Coverage exceptions for hardware-bound code

The 90% coverage gate (see Acceptance Criteria) assumes
every code path can run under `cargo llvm-cov` in CI.
Real projects routinely have I/O paths that can't:
audio playback, network calls against external
services, native API calls (Win32, CoreAudio, ALSA),
GPIO on embedded targets. The recipe for keeping the
gate honest without weakening it:

1. **Extract the hardware-bound code into a sibling
   submodule.** Given `foo.rs` that contains both
   business logic and an I/O call, split into `foo.rs`
   (the orchestrator) and `foo/bar.rs` (the I/O leaf).
   The leaf module should be as small as possible --
   ideally just the unmockable call plus its
   immediate error mapping.
2. **Add the leaf submodule to the coverage
   `IGNORE_REGEX`** in `xtask/src/coverage.rs`. The
   existing default excludes `src/main.rs` only; extend
   it with the new path. The leaf module is exempted
   from the gate; the orchestrator is not.
3. **Add a `*_TEST_*` env-var escape hatch in the
   excluded module.** For example, `BELLWETHER_TEST_AUDIO`
   short-circuits the real native call and returns a
   fixed `Ok`/`Err` shape. This keeps the parent
   module's post-call success and error branches
   testable -- they're the parts that actually carry
   business logic, and they remain inside the 90% gate.

What this gets you: the orchestrator is fully covered
(including both branches of its `match
play_audio_native() { Ok => ..., Err => ... }`), the
leaf is honestly acknowledged as untested in CI, and
there's no `#[cfg(test)]` test-only branch leaking into
production code paths.

When NOT to use this recipe: if the I/O can be faked
with a trait + dependency injection at the call site
without contortions, do that instead. The submodule-
plus-ignore-regex pattern is for cases where the
indirection itself would obscure the code more than it
reveals.

## Shell wrappers: bash and PowerShell twins

This template targets Windows, Linux, and macOS as
first-class platforms. The convention for cross-shell
tooling is: **non-trivial logic lives in `cargo
xtask`; shell files (`scripts/*.sh`, `*.ps1`) are
thin wrappers only.** This keeps a bugfix from having
to land twice in two languages whose semantics drift
(quoting, exit codes, error handling).

The canonical wrapper shapes are:

```bash
# scripts/foo.sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
exec cargo xtask foo -- "$@"
```

```powershell
# scripts/foo.ps1
$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'
& cargo xtask foo -- @args
exit $LASTEXITCODE
```

Exceptions are allowed where the logic genuinely
can't live in Rust without contortion -- e.g.
process-cleanup that pokes `Get-CimInstance` or
`pkill` directly, or bootstrap scripts that run
*before* `cargo` is available. Document such
exceptions inline so the next reader knows why the
file is not a wrapper.

## Lints: `doc_markdown` allowlist via `clippy.toml`

The workspace runs clippy with pedantic lints enabled
where practical. `clippy::doc_markdown` flags
identifiers like `PowerShell`, `JSON`, `FFI`,
`WebSocket`, `macOS`, `GitHub` in doc comments,
forcing every occurrence to be backticked even when
the prose reads naturally without backticks.

The template ships a `clippy.toml` at workspace root
with a curated `doc-valid-idents` allowlist of
infrastructure terms. The list extends clippy's
defaults (via the `".."` sentinel as the first entry)
rather than replacing them. Derived projects should
**append** their own domain-specific identifiers
(product names, acronyms, external systems) to that
file rather than redefining the list.

## Edition-2024 migration notes

The template ships on Rust edition 2024. Projects
inheriting from an older snapshot of the template (or
upgrading from edition 2021) routinely hit a small set
of mechanical fixes that `cargo fix --edition` either
applies automatically or flags:

- **Unsafe extern blocks**: `extern "C" { fn foo(); }`
  must become `unsafe extern "C" { fn foo(); }`. Each
  declaration inside is still individually `unsafe fn`.
- **Match ergonomics tightening**: bare `ref` patterns
  inside a binding that already implies a reference
  must be dropped. `match x { Some(ref y) => ... }`
  becomes `match x { Some(y) => ... }` when the outer
  match already produces a reference.
- **`gen` is reserved**: any identifier called `gen`
  (variables, function names, struct fields) needs the
  raw-identifier form `r#gen` or a rename.
- **Nested `if let` -> let chains**: clippy's autofix
  collapses `if x { if y { ... } }` into
  `if x && y { ... }` once `let`-chains are stable.
  This is a clippy fix rather than an edition fix, but
  it lands at the same time and is worth running in the
  same pass.

Run `cargo fix --edition --workspace` followed by
`cargo xtask validate` and expect a small follow-up
pass for the items above.

## Version source of truth

The project version lives in
`crates/bellwether/Cargo.toml`. Avoid putting the
version number in README body text or other markdown --
those copies drift silently from `Cargo.toml`. If a
version mention is unavoidable in user-facing prose,
embed it as a sentinel comment
(`<!-- version: 0.5.0 -->`) so a script can rewrite
both on release, or pull the value from `Cargo.toml`
via the build (CLI binaries can use
`env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")`).
